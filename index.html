Kazakhstan PhD Association in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be honoured to invite established researchers, PhD and Master students of your university to the Second Central Asian Research Forum on Sustainable Development and Innovation, which will take place in Loughborough (on 18 March 2019 ), United Kingdom, and in Astana (4 April 2019), Kazakhstan.


The Second Central Asian Research Forum on Sustainable Development and Innovation provides a platform to attract potential partners from government agencies and business structures to research projects of Kazakhstani young scientists, which are in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.


It is hoped that the Forum will result in a synergy between industry and young scientists, and aid the development of Kazakhstan and the other countries of Central Asia. The Forum also seeks to establish partnership links between the universities of Kazakhstan and United Kingdom. Notably, the Forum in the United Kingdom is organised in partnership with Loughborough University, which is ranked in the top 10 UK's universities and has a vast experience in the implementation of scientific projects aimed at sustainable development.


The Forum has received a great support from the government, industries, and academic institutions. The Sponsors and Partners of the Forum are as follows:
