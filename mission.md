The mission of the Kazakhstan PhD Association in the UK is in line with the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development, i.e. to end poverty, protect our planet, promote peace, and ensure prosperity for all by achieving SD goals by 2030 and improving the quality of life in Kazakhstan for the current and future generations.

On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 Targets to end poverty, protect our planet, promote peace, and ensure prosperity for all. All states, including Central Asian states, supported this initiative to achieve SD goals by 2030 and improve the quality of life in Central Asia for the current and future generations. The ultimate success of the SDGs depends on solid collaboration and partnership among all concerned actors: United Nations, governments, policy-makers, civil society, business sectors, local communities, as well as universities and researchers.

The committee is chaired by Aliya Sembayeva and Khalida Azhigulova
